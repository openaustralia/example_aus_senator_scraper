An example scraper that scrapes information about people from
https://morph.io/openaustralia/example_aus_senator_scrape.

The page to be scraped is really a simplified version of a real site listing Australian
members of parliament.

This was made for [PoplusCon](http://poplus.org/poplus_event.html)
